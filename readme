Well after all the changes. and tries. i find that the manifest wasnt pulling locl but from android no wonder nothing ever worked. But liquid did good work pulling this together so while i could revert now that i know why my aditions werent working just dont see a reason as its mostly same features but liquid had added alot more. so credit to liquid here. great work.
